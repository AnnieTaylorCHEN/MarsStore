The band consists of brothers Jared Leto (lead vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards) and Shannon Leto (drums, percussion). During the course of its existence, it has undergone various line-up changes.</p><p>The band's debut album, 30 Seconds to Mars (2002), was produced by Bob Ezrin and released to positive reviews but only to limited commercial success. The band achieved worldwide fame with the release of its second album A Beautiful Lie (2005), which received multiple certifications all over the world. Its next release, This Is War (2009), showed a dramatic evolution in the band's musical style, as it incorporated experimental music as well as eclectic influences. The recording process of the album was marked by a legal dispute with record label EMI that eventually became the subject of the documentary film Artifact (2012). Thirty Seconds to Mars then moved to Universal Music and released the fourth album, Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (2013), to critical and commercial success. It was followed by America (2018),which polarized critics upon release.</p></section><footer class=main-footer><div class="container main-footer-container"><ul class="nav footer-nav"><li><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/follow/1/?uri=spotify:artist:0RqtSIYZmd4fiBKVFqyIqD?si=LhjFFS4gSWGcidMKJvN7zA&size=detail&theme=dark" width=300 height=56 scrolling=no frameborder=0 style="border:none; overflow:hidden;" allowtransparency=true></iframe></li><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com target=_blank><img src="Images/YouTube Logo.png"></a></li><li><a href=https://www.facebook.com target=_blank><img src="Images/Facebook Logo.png"></a></li></ul></div></footer><script type=text/javascript src=about.3fee222c9fab60aaa4de.js></script></body></html>
