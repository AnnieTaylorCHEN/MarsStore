# Mars Store

This is a small school assignment project where I practise HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js (Express.js) as well as Stripe API. The tiny project tries to add server-side calculation and tracking fans' comments by using JSON. It also has an on page search function on the store page. 

Update: mongodb is used as database to replace the previous json for products. Sorting functions are added. Nodemailer is used for responding by email to message sent via contact page. 

The project is live at https://mars-store.herokuapp.com/
