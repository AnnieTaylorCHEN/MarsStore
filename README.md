# Mars Store

This is a small school assignment project where I practise HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js (Express.js) as well as Stripe API. The tiny project tries to add server-side calculation and tracking fans' comments by using JSON. It also has an on page search function on the store page (since database is not involved).
